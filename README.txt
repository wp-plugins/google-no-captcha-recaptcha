The plugin adds a No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA tag in Contact Form 7, which can be used to include a No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA anti-spam field.

== Description ==

Research has shown that the reCAPTCHA field can be decoded by smart bots 99% of the time. Google has thus introduced a 'No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA' API which has a risk analysis engine backing the verification process.
Integrate this API into your Contact Form 7 forms, using this plugin.

* The Google No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA plugin provides an option to set a custom error message when the CAPTCHA field is not set or if a robot is detected.

* The plugin is localization ready, which means you can display the error message in your local language.

* It also provides support to display the CAPTCHA in multiple languages.

* The plugin is multiform compatible.

* The plugin is multisite compatible. Do ensure that you add the keys for every sub-domain in the plugin's settings.
